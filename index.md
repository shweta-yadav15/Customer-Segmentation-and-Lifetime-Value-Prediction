## Background

E Commerce industry is forecasted to double in size within the next two years and grow from 3.53 trillion US dollars in retail ecommerce sales in 2019, up to 6.54 trillion US dollars in 2022. The key drivers of success over the next decade will be centered on building a deep understanding of and connection to the empowered consumer, and the only way to understand consumer behavior is to measure and analyze. 

## Motivation

This project deals with many real-world challenges faced by e-commerce websites that includes predicting customer lifetime value using RFM score and k-means clustering, customer segmentation to find out best valued customers. Also, predicting review score they customers will give to their order experience depending on their location, order cost and other factors. I have also done a detailed analysis of how geolocation can affect user's experience and their purchase and much more.

## Dataset

Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. Also included is a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This dataset have nine tables which are connected with few common attributes. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
